Why we use dot or colon as delimeter in chown?
Previous versions of the chown utility used the dot (``.'') character to
distinguish the group name. This has been changed to be a colon (``:'')
character, so that user and group names may contain the dot character

зачем x права на директории

The difference between "-" and "no hyphen" is that the latter keeps your
existing environment (variables, etc); the former creates a new environment
(with the settings of the actual user, not your own).

    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Su

    The hyphen has two effects:

    1) switches from the current directory to the home directory of the new user
(e.g., to /root in the case of the root user) by logging in as that user

    2) changes the environmental variables to those of the new user as dictated
by their ~/.bashrc. That is, if the first argument to su is a hyphen, the
current directory and environment will be changed to what would be expected if
the new user had actually logged on to a new session (rather than just taking
over an existing session)
